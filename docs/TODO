# TODO Write an interactive test suite for IOHandler. These tests will require actual user input but should provide
# directons to the user as to what they should type.
# TODO Make a main menu
# TODO Figure out how to have multi-page menus
# TODO Create a basic action menu
# TODO Create a location class (should areas hold locations or should locations be aware of areas?)
#
# NOTE When areas are implemented make sure that areas can be inside other areas (like a woodland area can be inside a kingdom)
