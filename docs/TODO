# TODO Write an interactive test suite for IOHandler. These tests will require actual user input but should provide
# directons to the user as to what they should type.
# TODO Create a basic action menu
# TODO Create a location class (should areas hold locations or should locations be aware of areas?)
# TODO For match options have each option contain a matched() function to implement more complex behaviour when an option is matched
#      (like if you want to just press "move north" instead of "move" and then in the submenu press "north"
# TODO Allow scrolling the log screen with the arrow keys
# TODO Only write last N lines to log file
#
# NOTE When areas are implemented make sure that locations can be in multiple areas (like in a woods and a kingdom)
